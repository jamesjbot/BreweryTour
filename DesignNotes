What are the problems
1.When favoriting a brewery from the map, I'm told that the action failed
but its completion is 50/50
2.When deleting all beers and breweries, I'm confronted with the same warning.
3.The SelectedBeers list does not show current labels.
4.UI is unresponsive when creating breweries
5.Add keyboard and dismiss to all tableview.
What are you testing now
I'm testing if changing the code for createBrewery to perfrom on
managed object context without blocking'

What did you learn from the stanford course
When doing saves on the manged object context always complete them within the
context with code like this
managedObjectContext.perform {

}
